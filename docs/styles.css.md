## Body Styles

The `body` selector is used to apply styles to the entire page. In this code, the `font-family` property is set to `'Inter', sans-serif`, which specifies that the font used in the document should be the "Inter" font if available, or a sans-serif font as a fallback.

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```

## Sticky Header

The `.sticky-header` class selector is used to style the sticky header element. The header is fixed at the top of the page using `position: fixed`. It spans the full width of the page (`width: 100%`) and has a white background color (`background-color: #ffffff`). A subtle box shadow is applied to give it a slight elevation effect (`box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`). The `z-index` property ensures that the header appears above other elements on the page.

```css
.sticky-header {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  z-index: 999;
}
```

### Logo Styles

The `.sticky-header .logo` selector targets the logo element within the sticky header. It is set to `display: inline-block`, which allows other elements to align next to it horizontally. The logo has padding (`padding: 10px`) to create some space around it.

```css

  padding: 10px;
}
```

The `.sticky-header .logo img` selector targets the image within the logo element. It sets the `height` property to `40px` and `vertical-align` to `middle`, which vertically aligns the image within the logo container.

  height: 40px;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Action Links Styles

The `.sticky-header .action-links` selector targets the container for action links within the sticky header. It is set to `display: inline-block`, allowing the action links to align horizontally. It also has `float: right` applied to move the container to the right side of the header. The container has padding (`padding: 10px`) to create some spacing.

```css
.sticky-header .action-links {
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

The `.sticky-header .action-links a` selector targets the anchor elements within the action links container. It sets the `margin-right` property to `10px`, creating space between the links. The links have a black color (`color: #000000`) and no text decoration (`text-decoration: none`).

```css
.sticky-header .action-links a {
  margin-right: 10px;
  color: #000000;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

The `.sticky-header .action-links a:last-child` selector targets the last anchor element within the action links container. It overrides the `margin-right` property and sets it to `0` to remove the margin on the last link.

}


```

The `.sticky-header .action-links .phone-icon`, `.sticky-header .action-links .email-icon`, and `.sticky-header .action-links .whatsapp-icon` selectors target specific icons within the action links container. They use custom classes to apply different colors to each icon. The phone icon is colored red (`color: #ff0000`), the email icon is also colored red, and the WhatsApp icon is colored green (`color: #25d366`).

```css
.sticky-header .action-links .phone-icon {
